You can use the Authorize First feature by selecting the desired duration of the authorization period for your orders. During this time, the customer’s funds are authorized (held), but not yet captured.

Enabling the Authorize First option is particularly interesting when processing subscription payments. This means the system will authorize the funds for a specific number of days before actually charging the customer. After this period, the transaction is captured and completed.

This has a key advantage: the client cannot initiate a chargeback during the authorization period, as the transaction has not been finalized. Once the set period ends, the payment is automatically captured.
