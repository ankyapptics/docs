    You can now customize your Club — [we’ll cover that in the next chapter](/knowledge-center/customizing20the20colors20of20your20deal20club20271bc8e2991b80a29f4ce5da68f9638c).

    Note: Your clubs will always be accessible at checkout.yourdomain.com/club.

Once you’ve [set up the offers for your users](/knowledge-center/create20an20offer20with20a20discount2026cbc8e2991b80e19cd0e390363bba18), you can create a Deal Club — a feature that’s automatically generated, fully compliant, and linked to those offers. You can then push offers directly to these Deal Clubs. The Deal Club is generated through the AI Point system.

Your Deal Club members can purchase products (offers) directly from the Deal Club page without having to re-enter their payment information. Since Apptics is PCI compliant, all payment data is securely saved.
