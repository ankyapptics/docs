To preview and publish your checkout, you first need to deploy it.

Deploying does _not_ mean it’s published — it simply means the checkout flow has been created and is ready for testing or further customization.

By default, your checkout will be accessible via a Apptics URL, meaning you won't have a custom domain at this stage.

However, you will have the option to set up a custom domain later if desired.
