    Note: Regarding the types of the upsell offers, there are several options:

    1. Primary means the upsell will be shown just before the payment button at your checkout.
    2. Secondary means the upsell will appear on the right side of your checkout.
    3. VIP we don’t recomment using it.
    4. Non interactive

    We recommend you starting with the secondary option. And if you are adding the second upsell offer, select it as a Primary.

In today’s competitive e-commerce landscape, maximizing average order value is more important than ever. One highly effective strategy to achieve this is through order bump upsells—a subtle yet powerful way to offer additional products or upgrades right at the point of purchase.

Note: You can set up your order bump upsells in your Apptics Checkout using one of the following trigger conditions:

1. Show the upsell when a specific product is in the cart – [covered in the previous section](https://docs.apptics.ai/Setting-Up-Order-Bumps/Setting-up-Order-Bump-Upsells-When-a-Specific-Product-is-in-the-Cart), or
2. Always show the upsell – explained in the section below.
