    Note: Regarding the types of upsell offers, there are several options available depending on their placement at the checkout page:

    1. Primary means the upsell will be displayed just below the payment button on your checkout page. You’ll also have the option to choose whether it is pre-checked or not.
    2. Secondary means the upsell will appear on the right side of your checkout, below the order recap.
    3. VIP means it will use custom buttons, which we don’t recomment using it.
    4. Non interactive means it will be prechecked, non clickable and non visible at checkout.

    We recommend you starting with the secondary option. And if you are adding the second upsell offer, select it as a Primary.

In today’s competitive e-commerce landscape, maximizing average order value is more important than ever. One highly effective strategy to achieve this is through order bump upsells—a subtle yet powerful way to offer additional products or upgrades right at the point of purchase.

Note: You can set up your order bump upsells in your Apptics Checkout using one of the following trigger conditions:

1. Show the upsell when a specific product is in the cart – explained in the section below, or
2. Always show the upsell – [covered in the next section](https://docs.apptics.ai/Setting-Up-Order-Bumps/Setting-up-order-bump-upsells-Always-Show-the-Upsells).
