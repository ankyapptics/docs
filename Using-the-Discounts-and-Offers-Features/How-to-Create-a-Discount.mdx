  </Step>
  <Step title="Under the Rules section, you can choose between two types of Rule Matching: Match ANY rule (OR) and Match ALL rules (AND), so you can choose whether the discount should apply when any of the rules are met, or only when all rules are met.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Then, you can choose between two rule types to determine when the discount should be applied: ">
    1. Contains specific product - Applies when the cart contains a specific product with optional minimum quantity. The system will count the total quantity of this product across all items in the cart.
    2. Minimum order amount - Applies when the cart total meets or exceeds a specified amount.

    If you select the option “Contains specific product”, this rule applies when the cart includes a specific product, with an optional minimum quantity. The system will count the total quantity of that product across all items in the cart. You’ll need to select the product, variant, and required quantity.

    If you select the second option, this rule applies when the total cart value meets or exceeds a specified amount. You’ll be prompted to enter the minimum cart value required.

    Note: You can add multiple rules to create a combination of conditions. Additionally, you can choose whether the discount should apply when any of the rules are met, or only when all rules are met.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Under Actions, you can select the action to be taken if your conditions are met:">
    Product discount (Product-specific and BXGY Ready) - Applies a discount to specific products. Can target specific products for BXGY (Buy X Get Y) promotions or apply to products matching the rules. Use 'Target Product' field for BXGY scenarios.
