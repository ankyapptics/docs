  <Step title="Choose the Dynamic Discount Strategy from the dropdown menu to define how your discount labels and prices will appear at checkout. You have two options:">
    1. Line-item allocation – The discount is applied directly to the product price. The discounted price will appear in red, and the discount title (e.g., "_1 bought = 1 free_") will be displayed under the item.
    2. Order-level discount – The discount appears below the items in the cart, highlighted in green, without modifying the individual item prices.
