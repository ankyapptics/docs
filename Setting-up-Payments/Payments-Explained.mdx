Payments are one of the core features of Apptics. As a PCI-compliant payment solution, we help merchants build and manage robust, secure payment infrastructures — and we’re proud to be recognized as leaders in the industry.

Apptics' payment setup is built around two main components:

1. Payment Processors
2. Payment Flow

First, you’ll need to add a payment processor to your Apptics account. We can also offer our own processor — Apptics Payments, built in partnership with Stripe.

In addition, we support other major processors, such as: NMI, Checkout.com, and many more coming soon!

Apptics gives you full flexibility — you can connect and use multiple processors simultaneously to optimize routing, reduce fees, or support different regions.

Then, you will need to set up your Payment Flow.

Let’s walk you through the process of setting up payments. Click on each section to learn more:
