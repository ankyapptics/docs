## 1. Create an account on Apptics

The first step in connecting Apptics is to create an account on the [website of our app](https://crm.apptics.ai).

    ![Snt 2 Upscaled](/images/snt2upscaled.png)

    ## **Under Configure Admin API scopes, Ideally you need to give permission for everything, But the must ones are:**

    read_products, write_products, read_products_feeds, write_products_feeds, read_products_listings, write_products_listings\
    read_orders, write_orders, read_orders_edits, write_orders_edits, write_draft_orders,\
    read_customers, write_customers\
    read_themes, write_themes

    read_discounts, write_discounts\
    \
    This step is VERY important, so please double-check that all the settings are correct.

    When you are done, click on the "Save" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="After giving the permissions, press the Install button on the Overview tab to get the access token unique for your new custom app">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm your action by pressing the Install button again">
    ![Snt 4 Upscaled](/images/snt4upscaled.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the window containing the three keys (credentials) crucial for running the custom app, on API credentials tab">
    ATTENTION: "Admin API access token" is generated and can be seen (revealed) just once. We highly recommend you to copy-paste it and store it in some secure place (like a digital vault). Or, for example, add it to some doc you use for keeping notes immediately upon seeing (revealing).
