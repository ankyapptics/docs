  <Step title="Check the window containing the three keys (credentials) crucial for running the custom app, on API credentials tab">
    ATTENTION: "Admin API access token" is generated and can be seen (revealed) just once. We highly recommend you to copy-paste it and store it in some secure place (like a digital vault). Or, for example, add it to some doc you use for keeping notes immediately upon seeing (revealing).
